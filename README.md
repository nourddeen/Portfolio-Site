# Portfolio-Site
This is my protfolio site 
I used a combonation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to make it.
I divided the main page to 3 seperate parts(home, About me, Resume) you can access the projects page from the menu tap on the top right corner.
I used FlexBox to make the site resposive in smartphone, tablet and desktop.
